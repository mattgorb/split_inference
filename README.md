# U-Shaped Split Inference

The main implementation of this model is in the llama3_7b folder.  Technical details are in the README in the llama3_7b folder.  

The debug folder has scripts I used during initial development.  For example, I used llama3_7b_model_split.py to test the split model in one file, and it is a good way to understand split inference in PyTorch/NCCL since the code is all in a single script.  

I implemented gpt2 first in the gpt2 folder. It can probably be deleted since this model sucks, but I'm leaving it for now.
